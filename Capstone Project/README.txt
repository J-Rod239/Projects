Depending on the operating system to open this program:
    Windows:
        Make sure to change the images file paths to your system path and when checking the path in the code; put double \\.
        The \\ have to go in the direction shown because that's the standard for Windows

    MacOS: Change path to your system and use // in order for the program to run.

When copying path straight from Finder or File Explorer, the path will only give one \ or /. You will have to put two of them for the program to work.

The reason for this is because the app does not read file permission and doesn't overwrite them. This is to avoid any system issues and loss of files or programs.
